    <h2>ABA Data Tracker is a data tracking app developed for ABA implementers.</h2>  
        <h2>ABA is short for “applied behavioral analysis” and implementers actively 
        record data concerning their client’s behaviors like occurrences of 
        elopement throughout a school day. </h2>
        <h2>ABA Data Tracker would allow implementers to login and easily record these data points.
        This app could ideally alleviate the impracticality of implementing ABA while taking data; 
        while also helping people related to the clients have a better understanding on the trends in the data, 
        based on graphs derived from the data stored within the app's database.</h2>

        <h2>Applied Behavioral Analysis is the use of basic behavior principles to analyzed and solve practical problems.</h2>
        <h2>Baseline: The base rate of behavior, before intervention, against which the efficacy of experimental manipulations is compared.</h2>
