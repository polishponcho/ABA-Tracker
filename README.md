# ABA-Tracker
Data Tracking app for ABA implementers
ABA Data Tracker is a data tracking app developed for ABA implementers.

ABA is short for “applied behavioral analysis” and implementers actively record data concerning their client’s behaviors like occurrences of elopement throughout a school day.

ABA Data Tracker would allow implementers to login and easily record these data points. This app could ideally alleviate the impracticality of implementing ABA while taking data; while also helping people related to the clients have a better understanding on the trends in the data, based on graphs derived from the data stored within the app's database.
